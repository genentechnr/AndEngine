IMPORTANT NOTES:
	- Maybe from now on one Buffer had to be used for Vertices, Color and and Tex coords.
		- Easy object coloring might not so easy anymore, as the color data in the buffer would need to be updated then.
		- Might be the easiest to introduce a common Mesh of constructor-defineable size, instead of 


OTHER NOTES:
	- Move glClearColor to Engine or SurfaceView
		- Introduce Engine.setClearColor(...)/enableClearColor(boolean)
	- Maybe introduce Color3/4 objects
		- Add Color3/4Pool
