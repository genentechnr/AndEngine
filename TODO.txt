TODOS:
	- Build allocation free Matrix class!
	- TODO Think about the default blendfunction (for sprites, but also for primitives).
		- For Sprites, keep premultiplyalpha in mind.
	- Old TextureRegionBuffer stuff now also goes into Mesh.
	- Eventually separate a TextureRegion from knowing what Texture it is on.
		- Makes it easier to switch textures during runtime.
		- Less disturbing when using multiple textures. 
		- Drawbacks?
	- All custom Exceptions extend from AndEngineException
	- Remove POT texture restriction
	- Maybe introduce Color3/4 objects
		- Add Color3/4Pool

EXAMPLES:
	- Blur/Bloom Shader?

	- Custom Text Mesh that shows how to color letters individually and make those colors change over time using a custom shader.
